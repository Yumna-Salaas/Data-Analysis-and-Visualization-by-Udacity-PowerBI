## Course Description

This program will equip any learner who wants to develop in-demand skills in data pre-processing, visualization, and analysis using Power BI as the primary tool. The course covers a comprehensive set of skills, including data extraction, transformation, modeling, visualization, and advanced analysis techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Data Model for SSTC Company

**Project Overview:**

In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) that combines information from all over the company. Your data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea beverages sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as your career progresses, the core principles remain the same.

**Project Steps:**

1. Correctly getting the data from various sources and using them in Power Query.
2. Structuring, combining, and cleaning the data.
3. Creating a dynamic Date Table that follows the Fiscal year of SSTC company.
4. Building relationships between tables with correct multiplicity.
5. Writing suitable measures such as Gross-Profit-Margin and Unit-Sales-By-Product.
6. Creating a simple and meaningful report with a summary.

**Skills Developed:**

- Data transformation
- DAX
- Power Query
- Business reporting fluency
- Relational data models
- Power BI Calculated Columns and Measures
- Data extraction
- Power BI Data Types
- Power BI Get Data
- Stakeholder management
- Power BI Report Design
- Power BI Data Pipeline
- Table design

### 2. Report for Waggle

**Project Overview:**

You work as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. You’re excited because your work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.
**Project Steps:**

1. Building the custom theme based on Waggle color palette.
2. Building meaningful charts, plots, and maps (Bar, Line, Donut, Matrix, Card, Scatter, Bubble map).
3. Customizing and modifying the charts, plots, and maps to allow easier visibility and extract meaningful insights faster.
4. Creating a banner with the logo, navigation, and buttons.
5. Creating various types of slicers/filters (slider, hierarchy, dropdown, search).
6. Building interactive buttons with bookmarks.

**Skills Developed:**

- Power BI Report Customization
- Data visualization design
- Power BI Report Design
- Stakeholder management
- Business reporting fluency
- Advanced data visualizations
- Data storytelling
- Basic data visualizations
- Data visualization
- Business metrics
