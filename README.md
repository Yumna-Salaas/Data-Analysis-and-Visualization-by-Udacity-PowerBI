## Course Description

This program will equip any learner who wants to develop in-demand skills in data pre-processing, visualization, and analysis using Power BI as the primary tool. The course covers a comprehensive set of skills, including data extraction, transformation, modeling, visualization, and advanced analysis techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Data Model for SSTC Company

**Project Overview:**

This course is a crucial step in Power BI for anyone who needs to mash together multiple data sources, clean them, restructure them, and harmonize them into a single and efficient data model to support reporting. We cover Power BIâ€™s built-in Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool, Power Query, learn foundational data modeling principles, cover some introductory DAX (Data Analytics Expressions), and touch on troubleshooting and optimization.

**Project Steps:**

1. Correctly getting the data from various sources and using them in Power Query.
2. Structuring, combining, and cleaning the data.
3. Creating a dynamic Date Table that follows the Fiscal year of SSTC company.
4. Building relationships between tables with correct multiplicity.
5. Writing suitable measures such as Gross-Profit-Margin and Unit-Sales-By-Product.
6. Creating a simple and meaningful report with a summary.

**Skills Developed:**

- Data transformation
- DAX
- Power Query
- Business reporting fluency
- Relational data models
- Power BI Calculated Columns and Measures
- Data extraction
- Power BI Data Types
- Power BI Get Data
- Stakeholder management
- Power BI Report Design
- Power BI Data Pipeline
- Table design

### 2. Report for Waggle

**Project Overview:**

In this course, students learn how to carry Power BI beyond mere bar charts and transform their reports into data exploration and storytelling tools that companies can use to better understand their data.

**Project Steps:**

1. Building the custom theme based on Waggle color palette.
2. Building meaningful charts, plots, and maps (Bar, Line, Donut, Matrix, Card, Scatter, Bubble map).
3. Customizing and modifying the charts, plots, and maps to allow easier visibility and extract meaningful insights faster.
4. Creating a banner with the logo, navigation, and buttons.
5. Creating various types of slicers/filters (slider, hierarchy, dropdown, search).
6. Building interactive buttons with bookmarks.

**Skills Developed:**

- Power BI Report Customization
- Data visualization design
- Power BI Report Design
- Stakeholder management
- Business reporting fluency
- Advanced data visualizations
- Data storytelling
- Basic data visualizations
- Data visualization
- Business metrics

### 3. Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain

**Project Overview:**

Using Power BI, the overarching goal of the course is to help students become effective at the process of retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing data in order to answer questions and draw conclusions. After learning about descriptive and inferential statistics, histograms, linear regression, and the concepts of correlation and probability, the course moves into M, the language of Power Query to build custom formulas as part of the data transformation process. Students then learn the language of DAX to analyze data. The final lesson of the course goes through a number of visualizations in Power BI and explores how those visuals may be used, edited, or enhanced to effectively relay information to an audience.

**Project Goal:**

The goal of the project is to create a market analysis report for a national clothing company to lure customers back as the sales have been flat.

**Project Steps:**

1. Correctly getting the data from various sources, then correctly format, clean, and structure the data using Power Query.
2. Setting up logical table relationships.
3. Creating a map to visualize the distribution of average income across the USA.
4. Building a Regression Table to summarize average customer sales by state.
5. Creating a scatterplot to analyze the relationship between average incomes and average sales.
6. Using measures to calculate regression formulas.
7. Creating calculated columns to predict customer incomes.
8. Using DAX to categorize predicted incomes into ranges to determine the best product fit for each customer with a histogram visual.
9. Performing additional necessary analysis to further improve the sales plan.
10. Writing a market analysis report with all findings and a summary.

**Skills Developed:**

- DAX
- Power Query
- Data fluency
- Advanced data visualizations
- Predictive analytics
- Historical data analysis
- Stakeholder management
- Power BI Calculated Columns and Measures
- Data transformation
- Basic descriptive statistics
- Data visualization design
